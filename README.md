<p align="justify">In this mini project, I have chosen to built a game which is developed as a mobile application named as “BOUNCE”. This is the adaptation of the popular game "Flappy Bird" but made and developed entirely in flutter using object as ball instead of bird. The main task is to help dodge the barriers and achieve the maximum score possible with the ball carefully</p>
